# Abstract
This report describes a number of substructural features which can help to identify compounds that appear as frequent
hitters (promiscuous compounds) in many biochemical high throughput screens. The compounds identified by such
substructural features are not recognized by filters commonly used to identify reactive compounds. Even though these
substructural features were identified using only one assay detection technology, such compounds have been reported to
be active from many different assays. In fact, these compounds are increasingly prevalent in the literature as potential
starting points for further exploration, whereas they may not be.
