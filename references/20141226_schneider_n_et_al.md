# Abstract
Fingerprint methods applied to molecules have proven to be useful for similarity determination and as inputs to
machine-learning models. Here, we present the development of a new fingerprint for chemical reactions and validate its
usefulness in building machine-learning models and in similarity assessment. Our final fingerprint is constructed as the
difference of the atom-pair fingerprints of products and reactants and includes agents via calculated physicochemical
properties. We validated the fingerprints on a large data set of reactions text-mined from granted United States patents
from the last 40 years that have been classified using a substructure-based expert system. We applied machine learning
to build a 50-class predictive model for reaction-type classification that correctly predicts 97% of the reactions in an
external test set. Impressive accuracies were also observed when applying the classifier to reactions from an in-house
electronic laboratory notebook. The performance of the novel fingerprint for assessing reaction similarity was evaluated
by a cluster analysis that recovered 48 out of 50 of the reaction classes with a median F-score of 0.63 for the
clusters. The data sets used for training and primary validation as well as all python scripts required to reproduce the
analysis are provided in the Supporting Information.
