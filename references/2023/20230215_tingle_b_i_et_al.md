# Abstract
Purchasable chemical space has grown rapidly into the tens of billions of molecules, providing unprecedented
opportunities for ligand discovery but straining the tools that might exploit these molecules at scale. We have
therefore developed ZINC-22, a database of commercially accessible small molecules derived from multi-billion-scale
make-on-demand libraries. The new database and tools enable analog searching in this vast new space via a facile GUI,
CartBlanche, drawing on similarity methods that scale sublinearly in the number of molecules. The new library also uses
data organization methods, enabling rapid lookup of molecules and their physical properties, including conformations,
partial atomic charges, cLogP values, and solvation energies, all crucial for molecule docking, which had become slow
with older database organizations in previous versions of ZINC. As the libraries have continued to grow, we have been
interested in finding whether molecular diversity has suffered, for instance, because certain scaffolds have come to
dominate via easy analoging. This has not occurred thus far, and chemical diversity continues to grow with database
size, with a log increase in Bemisâ€“Murcko scaffolds for every two-log unit increase in database size. Most new scaffolds
come from compounds with the highest heavy atom count. Finally, we consider the implications for databases like ZINC as
the libraries grow toward and beyond the trillion-molecule range. ZINC is freely available to everyone and may be
accessed at https://cartblanche22.docking.org, via Globus, and in the Amazon AWS and Oracle OCI clouds.
