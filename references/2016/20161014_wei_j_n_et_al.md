# Abstract
Reaction prediction remains one of the major challenges for organic chemistry and is a prerequisite for efficient
synthetic planning. It is desirable to develop algorithms that, like humans, "learn" from being exposed to examples of
the application of the rules of organic chemistry. We explore the use of neural networks for predicting reaction types,
using a new reaction fingerprinting method. We combine this predictor with SMARTS transformations to build a system
which, given a set of reagents and reactants, predicts the likely products. We test this method on problems from a
popular organic chemistry textbook.
