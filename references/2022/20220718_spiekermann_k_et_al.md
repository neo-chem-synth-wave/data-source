# Abstract
Quantitative chemical reaction data, including activation energies and reaction rates, are crucial for developing
detailed kinetic mechanisms and accurately predicting reaction outcomes. However, such data are often difficult to find,
and high-quality datasets are especially rare. Here, we use CCSD(T)-F12a/cc-pVDZ-F12//ωB97X-D3/def2-TZVP to obtain
high-quality single point calculations for nearly 22,000 unique stable species and transition states. We report the
results from these quantum chemistry calculations and extract the barrier heights and reaction enthalpies to create a
kinetics dataset of nearly 12,000 gas-phase reactions. These reactions involve H, C, N, and O, contain up to seven heavy
atoms, and have cleaned atom-mapped SMILES. Our higher-accuracy coupled-cluster barrier heights differ significantly
(RMSE of ∼5 kcal mol−1) relative to those calculated at ωB97X-D3/def2-TZVP. We also report accurate transition state
theory rate coefficients between 300 K and 2000 K and the corresponding Arrhenius parameters for a subset of rigid
reactions. We believe this data will accelerate development of automated and reliable methods for quantitative reaction
prediction.
