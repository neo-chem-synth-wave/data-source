# Abstract
RetroRules is a database of reaction rules for metabolic engineering (https://retrorules.org). Reaction rules are
generic descriptions of chemical reactions that can be used in retrosynthesis workflows in order to enumerate all
possible biosynthetic routes connecting a target molecule to its precursors. The use of such rules is becoming
increasingly important in the context of synthetic biology applied to de novo pathway discovery and in systems biology
to discover underground metabolism due to enzyme promiscuity. Here, we provide for the first time a complete set
containing > 400 000 stereochemistry-aware reaction rules extracted from public databases and expressed in the
community-standard SMARTS (SMIRKS) format, augmented by a rule representation at different levels of specificity (the
atomic environment around the reaction center). Such numerous representations of reactions expand natural chemical
diversity by predicting de novo reactions of promiscuous enzymes.
