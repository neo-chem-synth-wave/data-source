## Main Publication Abstract
Presently, software tools for retrosynthetic analysis are widely used by organic, medicinal, and computational chemists.
Rule-based systems extensively use collections of retro-reactions (transforms). While there are many public datasets
with reactions in synthetic direction (usually non-generic reactions), there are no publicly-available databases with
generic reactions in computer-readable format which can be used for the purposes of retrosynthetic analysis. Here we
present RetroTransformDB—a dataset of transforms, compiled and coded in SMIRKS line notation by us. The collection is
comprised of more than 100 records, with each one including the reaction name, SMIRKS linear notation, the functional
group to be obtained, and the transform type classification. All SMIRKS transforms were tested syntactically,
semantically, and from a chemical point of view in different software platforms. The overall dataset design and the
retrosynthetic fitness were analyzed and curated by organic chemistry experts. The RetroTransformDB dataset may be used
by open-source and commercial software packages, as well as chemoinformatics tools.
