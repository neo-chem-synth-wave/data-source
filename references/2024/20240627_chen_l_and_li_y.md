# Abstract
This paper presents AutoTemplate, an innovative data preprocessing protocol, addressing the crucial need for
high-quality chemical reaction datasets in the realm of machine learning applications in organic chemistry. Recent
advances in artificial intelligence have expanded the application of machine learning in chemistry, particularly in
yield prediction, retrosynthesis, and reaction condition prediction. However, the effectiveness of these models hinges
on the integrity of chemical reaction datasets, which are often plagued by inconsistencies like missing reactants,
incorrect atom mappings, and outright erroneous reactions. AutoTemplate introduces a two-stage approach to refine these
datasets. The first stage involves extracting meaningful reaction transformation rules and formulating generic reaction
templates using a simplified SMARTS representation. This simplification broadens the applicability of templates across
various chemical reactions. The second stage is template-guided reaction curation, where these templates are
systematically applied to validate and correct the reaction data. This process effectively amends missing reactant
information, rectifies atom-mapping errors, and eliminates incorrect data entries. A standout feature of AutoTemplate is
its capability to concurrently identify and correct false chemical reactions. It operates on the premise that most
reactions in datasets are accurate, using these as templates to guide the correction of flawed entries. The protocol
demonstrates its efficacy across a range of chemical reactions, significantly enhancing dataset quality. This
advancement provides a more robust foundation for developing reliable machine learning models in chemistry, thereby
improving the accuracy of forward and retrosynthetic predictions. AutoTemplate marks a significant progression in the
preprocessing of chemical reaction datasets, bridging a vital gap and facilitating more precise and efficient machine
learning applications in organic synthesis.
